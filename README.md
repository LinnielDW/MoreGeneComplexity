# MoreGeneComplexity
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2876012466

A mod that allows you to change the max gene complexity for the gene system introduced in Biotech, for all your powercrept needs!
By default adds a flat 5 extra complexity and sets the minimum metabolic efficiency to -10, but can be configured in the mod settings.

Note: As it stands, the hunger malus from a geneset's metabolic efficiency caps out at -5, but the geneset's metabolic efficiency can still be reduced, down to your defined min.
